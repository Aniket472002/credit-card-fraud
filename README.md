Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍💳

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. It leverages classification algorithms to identify anomalies in transaction data and distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

📊 Dataset
Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Contains 284,807 transactions with 492 fraud cases (highly imbalanced).
Features are anonymized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
🛠 Technologies Used
✔ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
✔ Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
✔ Data Preprocessing (SMOTE for balancing, StandardScaler)
✔ Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
✔ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve)

🔄 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, scaling, and balancing data.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.
3️⃣ Model Training – Implementing multiple ML models for comparison.
4️⃣ Evaluation & Optimization – Analyzing model performance and improving accuracy.

📌 Results
✅ XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (~99%) with strong recall and precision.
✅ SMOTE balancing improved fraud detection performance.
✅ Feature importance analysis provided insights into transaction patterns.
